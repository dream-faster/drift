We’re building:

- A package that helps you deploy your `fold` pipelines.

- Our own implementation of new and classic time series models, providing an additional order of magnitude speedup during backtesting (while supporting online updates when deployed).

- Time Series AutoML without lookahead bias, to get accurate simulated performance on past data that you can rely on.

- Training models on multiple time series at the same time, with synchronized Adaptive Models.

- Full support for Uncertainty Quantification, making it an internal part of Fold.

And many more…
